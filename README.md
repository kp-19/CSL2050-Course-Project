# CSL2050-Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning
## Course Project : Twitter Sentiment Analysis

### Project description:

A text can provide extensive insight into the sentiment conveyed by the author. Consequently,
sentiment analysis derived from textual input is a well-established problem statement in the domains
of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). In this project, we aimed to address
this challenge by employing a conventional machine learning methodology to analyze a dataset of
over 30,000 tweets from Twitter. The objective was to implement and analyze different classifiers
on the Sentiment Analysis Dataset, utilizing various preprocessing techniques (LDA & PCA) and
tokenizers (BERTTokenizer and TFIDtokenizer). The project explored and thoroughly analyzed
the performance of classifiers- Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVMs, Naive-Bayes, Perceptron and
Logistic Regression, optimizing each to yield maximum accuracy by modifying any parameters or
hyperparameter tuning. Finally, ensemble learning was employed to achieve optimum performance
of the model. It was observed that TFID gave the maximum accuracy, which reached as high as 71.5
